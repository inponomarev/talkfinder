<p>In this talk, we will discuss the memory reclamation problem, existing techniques, and how a recent wait-free WFE technique is constructed. We discuss what key challenges WFE solves so that it can be universally applied regardless of the data structure organization.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>&lt;p&gt;As the number of cores grows, efficient concurrent data structures have become increasingly important because they reduce sequential execution times, and thereby yield scalable performance.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&lt;p&gt;Non-blocking data structures have received particular attention in practice due to their synchronization properties that are relevant in multi-threaded environments, especially their platform-independent progress guarantees â€” i.e., the ability for threads to make progress without depending on the OS or VM schedulers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A number of concurrency libraries for programming languages such as C&#43;&#43; and Java have been developed. However, efficient non-blocking memory reclamation is still a challenge, especially in languages with manual memory management such as C&#43;&#43;. In such settings, not only memory has to be safely reclaimed, but also memory usage must remain bounded. Otherwise, memory can be exhausted, which violates progress properties.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&lt;p&gt;Wait-free data structures are critical in latency-sensitive applications, as they offer the strongest progress property: all threads make progress in a bounded number of steps. Although they were historically slower and more tedious to implement than their lock-free counterparts, they are now gaining more traction due to a number of techniques such as Kogan and Petrank&#8217;s fast-path-slow-path methodology.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&lt;p&gt;Wait-free memory reclamation, until recently, remained a challenge since existing methodologies cannot be directly applied to the memory reclamation problem. One way to address the challenge is to use non-blocking techniques such as Hazard Pointers or Hazard Eras but modify data structures, e.g., use a "normalized" Timnat and Petrank&#8217;s form. The "normalized" form guarantees that any operation that does not make progress can be restarted. The process of normalization has several limitations, e.g., requires that only CAS (compare-and-swap) operations are used by data structures. However, there is a growing interest in using specialized instructions such as FAA (fetch-and-add) for which no general normalization methodology exists.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&lt;p&gt;What if there was a more general way to organize reclamation in wait-free data structures regardless of their presentation? A recent algorithm, WFE (Wait-Free Eras), achieves exactly that by extending (lock-free) Hazard Eras.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
