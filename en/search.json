These new heterogeneous devices include multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. This trend has been followed by changes in software development norms that do not necessarily favor programmers. \n\nA prime example is the two most popular heterogeneous programming languages, CUDA and OpenCL, which expose several low-level features to the API, making them difficult to use by non-expert users. Instead of using low-level programming languages, developers in industry and academia tend to use higher-level, object-oriented programming languages, typically executed on managed runtime environments, such as Java, R, Python, and JavaScript. Although many programmers might expect that such programming languages would have already been adapted for transparent execution on heterogeneous hardware, the reality is that their support is either very limited or absent. \n\nIn this talk, we present TornadoVM, a plugin for OpenJDK that allows Java programmers to automatically run on Heterogeneous Hardware such as multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. Furthermore, TornadoVM can perform task-migration from one device to another at runtime, entirely transparent for the user. To do so, TornadoVM consists of three software components: \n1) A simple API for composing pipelines of existing Java methods. \n2) An optimizing JIT compiler that extends the Graal compiler with hardware-aware optimizations that generate OpenCL C code. \n3) A runtime system that executes TornadoVM specific bytecodes, performs memory management and schedules the code for execution on GPUs, multi-core CPUs, and FPGAs.  \n\nThe target audience for this talk is Java programmers that would like to smoothly run programs on GPUs and FPGAs without any knowledge about the underlying hardware details, and complex parallel and heterogeneous programming models.",

The challenges that developers face today are different from the problems that we used to solve earlier. Creators of the Java runtime respond to this with the appropriate functionality in the JDK. For example, an inexpensive cloud instance can be quite powerful. And it runs a bunch of containers. Then JVMs running in different containers compete for instance resources.

There's always a risk of actually changing the semantics during refactoring if the developer makes a mistake in the process. Further testing isn't always able to detect this regression in time. Besides, the developers are often afraid of such regression and so avoid using refactoring even in cases when it can be really useful.\n\nBut we can often divide the refactoring process into atomic steps, or transactions; after each step the semantics is saved.

It is a managed compute platform that automatically scales your stateless containers and abstracts away all infrastructure management, so developers can focus on building great applications.\n\nMicroservices architecture uses an assembly of fine-grained services, often packaged in containers, to deliver functionality. While there are several advantages of microservices architecture, most notably faster code to production by reducing the dependencies between teams, it has the drawback of significant management overhead.\n\nThis talk describes how CloudRun can be used to implement Microservices architecture without the need for management overhead that comes with Microservices and is cheaper to operate since you only pay for what you use (in a Serverless fashion).\n\nA major issue with Microservices architecture is distributed data management and sagas are used to ensure data consistency across services. The talk covers, how to implement distributed sagas as a protocol for coordinating request among multiple containers.\n\nThe talk elaborates on how <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/tasks/\" target=\"_blank\">Clouds Tasks</a>, a managed service that allows you to manage the execution, dispatch, and delivery of a large number of distributed tasks, can be used to increase performance of the system by increasing the throughput & response times.\n\nAlso, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud Scheduler</a>, a managed enterprise-grade scheduler, can be used to schedule virtually any job, including batch, big data jobs, cloud infrastructure operations, and more. The talk shows an example on how you can automate retries in case of failure to reduce manual toil and intervention. Cloud Scheduler can even act as a single pane of glass, allowing you to manage all your automation tasks from one place.\n\nCloud Run is <a href=\"www.knative.dev\" target=\"_blank\">Knative</a> compatible, so it is possible to implement a hybrid system through a combination of Knative & Cloud Run. Event multi-cloud systems can be implemented since Cloud Run application can be made to run on any kubernetes cluster including GKE.\n\nThe talk covers some best practices to follow, particularly around schema isolation and avoiding common data ownership. Moreover, it emphasizes the need for having a rollback mechanism (which is needed for sagas anyway) and adopting eventual consistency for designing fault tolerant systems. Some aspects on how testing application are covered using local testing for faster feedback cycles.\n\nThe objective of this talk is to understand the benefits of implementing microservices architecture as a Cloud Run and to enable the developer to navigate through the pitfalls during the implementation stage.",

And the most interesting how \"Das Kapital\" by Karl Marx will help answer all these questions.A lot of us are too young to remember, but the 50s and 60s were not a particularly cheerful era to be in computing. And no, Roman is not talking about the dress code for developers. He's talking about the awful monopolies around compute infrastructure that defined that period in our history. You see, back then, if you wanted to earn your paycheck doing computing it meant selling your soul to IBM and hoping for a small slice, the breadcrumbs really, of an enormous concentration of computing power bottled up in one of its mainframes. Then Silicon Valley and minicomputers happened and the world was alright for any little geek to live in again.\n\nWhat is happening in front of our eye right now is, in many respects, a replay of the 50s and 60s. We see a handful of companies building a modern-day equivalent of mainframes. This time, somehow, they are called hyperscale clouds, but that's where the difference ends. While initially skeptical, most Fortune 500 companies are now enthusiastically embracing moving almost all their IT operations into the Cloud (to a point where even Pentagon's future is going to be very cloudy). And who can blame them? The quantity and quality of the services offered by the hyperscale cloud providers are second to none. It will be madness to replicate even a small percentage of those services in an environment of traditional datacenters of yore. \n\nThe DevOps community, of course, is a major catalyst of this change: constantly helping spread the gospel of hyperscale clouds and forever accelerating the adoption of more and more cloud-native services.\n\nBut is this the future we dreamed of? Did you ever expect \"Hello, World!\" web application to require 9 microservices and at least two different platforms to manage them? Does a computer industry, dominated by a handful of closed source, extremely well-financed multinational companies exerting their will on the rest of us (while brutally eliminating all competition) make you shudder and feel like you're entering a really bad dream?

They have originally been introduced to make moving objects more efficient: the object an rvalue reference references is assumed to go out of scope soon and thus may have its resources scavenged without harm. The C++ standard library, for example, std::cref or std::ranges, makes use of yet another aspect of rvalue references: since they go out of scope soon, it is assumed unsafe to hold on to them beyond the scope of the current function, while lvalue references are considered safe. We, too, found this assumption to be very useful for smart memory management, particularly in generic code. \n\nUnfortunately, the C++ language itself violates this assumption in at least two places. First, rvalues bind to const&. This means that innocent-looking functions taking a parameter by const& and passing it through in some way silently convert rvalues to lvalue references, hiding any lifetime limitation of the rvalues. Std::min/max are two such examples. Worse still, every accessor member function returning a const& to a member suffers from this problem. Second, a temporary lifetime extension is meant to make binding a temporary to a reference safe by extending the lifetime of the temporary. But this only works as long as the temporary is still a prvalue. If the temporary has been passed through a function, even it has been correctly passed through by rvalue reference, lifetime extension will no longer be invoked and we get a dangling reference. These problems are not merely theoretical. We have had hard-to-find memory corruption in our code because of these problems.\n\nIn this talk, Arno will describe the problems in detail, present a library-only approach to mitigate the problems, and finally, make an impossible-to-ever-get-into-the-standard proposal of how to put things right.",

This means parsing, DDoS attacks, click frauds and much more. Such solutions are high performance network applications that can pass large traffic volume through itself per unit time. Despite all the disadvantages that are typical for C++ in the enterprise perhaps modern C++ is the most suitable programming language for such tasks. Not only because he can provide suitable performance and is itself a powerful tool, but also because with new standards and such frameworks as boost the learning curve is not as high as it might seem first.\n\nA lot of network applications for work with HTTP traffic have classic architecture. There you meet a server, client, sessions, pools, parsers, and serializers. It's a common set of classes that is very convenient to develop on boost.asio and boost.beast today. But if we're talking about a serious traffic volume examples that each of us copies from boost.asio documentation and develops further for tasks may not be as good as it might seem. They require careful improvement in a serious product.\n\nInside of Nikolay's team, a long way has been done to develop similar code. They supported many features from rfc for http 1.1. They implemented their lines and stream buffers compatible with boost.asio.streambuf which allowed minimizing memory copying between server and client sessions in the moment of traffic proxying. As a result, we got a network application that works well in production and can withstand heavy loads and solve the business task. \n\nBut nothing is perfect. A problem which Nikolay and his team encountered at a late stage is memory fragmentation caused by the constant creation of server sessions to handle incoming connections. Problem that could not be solved with help of tcmalloc and jemalloc was solved due to slab allocators (C++ covering over the small framework from Tarantool) which reduced the time application spent in malloc and new by more than two times and saved us from memory fragmentation. This decision imposed certain restrictions on the application architecture adding its difficulties in writing asynchronous and multi-threaded code on boost.asio, but it gave the expected result.\n\nIn this talk will be discussed how Nikolay and his team overcame the difficulties. Speaker will also mention the application architecture which required such difficult optimizations and proceeds to slab allocators and boost.asio.

We will see how this can be used to navigate the tension between object-oriented and value-oriented design, and build an example interactive application using Qt and QML against a value-based data-model.\n\nValue-oriented design reconciles functional and procedural programming by focusing on value semantics. Like functional programming, it promotes local reasoning and composition — it is, however, pragmatic and can be implemented in idiomatic C++. In previous talks, the speaker has discussed how immutable data-structures help use value semantics at scale, and how the Unidirectional Data-flow Architecture (Redux, Elm) provide a solid foundation for designing interactive software based on values and functions.\n\nHowever, we rarely have the luxury of starting from scratch. We are often embedded in legacy codebases with Frankensteinian designs crystalized over decades of multi-paradigm evolution. Also, it's hard to build serious interactive software without frameworks like Qt or Juce that, with all its power, also impose a Javaish object-oriented approach at the boundaries of our system.

Coroutines are the base for cooperative tasks, event loops, infinite data streams, or pipelines.\n\nConcepts will change the way we think and program templates. They are semantic categories for the valid template arguments. They enable you to express your intention directly in the type system. If something goes wrong, you will get a short error message.\n\nModules will overcome the restrictions of header files. They promise a lot.

The deadlines are tough, you need to write business logic, but the infrastructure is stuck. After a couple of months you realize that the deadline is close, open browser tabs are growing exponentially and each task, each meeting raises more questions than answers. Autofac or Castle Windsor? Entity Framework or Dapper? NLog or Serilog? Rich model or Anemic?\n\nAlexey's team was in such a situation. They needed a fast start and a solid frame for a huge enterprise-project so they can focus on business logic and not think about infrastructure. Their solution was ASP.NET Boilerplate (ABP), the framework from Turkey.\n\nDuring this session, Alexey will tell how to make high-quality complex applications on the .NET stack in a short time.

You can use Paint Worklet already (some browsers supported it), that takes parameters which value syntax is describing in definition syntax (its subset, but still).\n\nDefinition syntax is coming from specs to the code.

How can we prove correctness is not the right question to ask. The right question to ask is: \"Can we ever prove correctness?\"\n\nWe’ll explore and compare the parallels between mathematics and physics, and types and tests. If physics cannot prove its theories are truthful, why do we believe it? We believe it for the same reason we believe in tests: we make observations, create models and check if reality matches our assumptions. When we have a formal system with well-defined rules, such as we have in mathematics, things change: truth is now attainable. We’ll explore the most brilliant ideas in the field of computer science and see how they can be applied to make better software, faster, with fewer bugs.\n\nGoing beyond theory, we’ll see how we can better use TypeScript’s features to make impossible states indeed impossible by using generics, conditional types, intersection and union types, discriminated unions and exhaustiveness checking and many others, after all, since TypeScript is Turing Complete, with it we can write any program that has ever been written or that will ever be written.\n\nGetting even more practical, we’ll see what testing tools are available to us and how they complement each other: we’ll dig deep in the differences between how these tools work so that we can make informed choices about them and what is the role of each.

    "content": "The talk discusses the importance of crash-consistency in storage systems and how we build an efficient infrastructure to find crash-consistency bugs.Problem description: Crash-consistency is the ability of a storage system to recover to a correct state after a crash due to power loss or a kernel panic. What we mean by a correct state is to check if the internal metadata structures are consistent, and that the files and directories persisted before the crash are not lost or contain corrupt data. The potential consequences of crash-consistency bugs could be disastrous, leading to loss of user data or resulting in unusable system state after recovery. However, there is little to no crash-consistency testing today for widely-used Linux file systems such as ext4, xfs, btrfs, and F2FS. Linux file-system developers use xfstests, an ad-hoc collection of correctness tests, to perform regression testing. xfstests contains a total of around 500 correctness tests that are applicable to all POSIX file systems. Of these tests, only about 30 (5%) are crash-consistency tests. Thus, file-system developers have no easy way of systematically testing the crash consistency of their file systems.\n\nSolution: We present a new approach to testing file-system crash consistency: bounded black-box crash testing (B3). B3 tests the file system in a black-box manner using workloads of file-system operations. Since the space of possible workloads is infinite, B3 bounds this space based on parameters such as the number of file-system operations or which operations to include, and exhaustively generates workloads within this bounded space. Each workload is tested on the target file system by simulating power-loss crashes while the workload is being executed and checking automatically if the file system recovers to a correct state after each crash. B3 builds upon insights derived from our study of crash-consistency bugs reported in Linux file systems in the last five years. We observed that most reported bugs can be reproduced using small workloads of three or fewer file-system operations on a newly-created file system, and that all reported bugs result from crashes after fsync() related system calls. We built the tool CrashMonkey to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. CrashMonkey revealed 10 new crash-consistency bugs in widely-used, mature Linux file systems, seven of which existed in the kernel since 2014. It also revealed a data loss bug in a verified file system, FSCQ. The new bugs result in severe consequences like broken rename atomicity and loss of persisted files.",

Even though it is crucial for working software, developing and maintaining tests takes certain time and effort — especially for distributed applications or when changes in existing functionality forces test scenarios to adapt. Omitting software tests can’t be the solution; therefore, how can we tackle enterprise tests effectively and productively?\n\nThis session shows what is necessary to effectively test Java Enterprise microservices in an automated way. We’ll see which approaches worked well in real-world projects, how to keep fast feedback and constant velocity in our development circle, how to manage complex test scenarios that involve multiple services, and how to verify our API contracts. The development productivity must keep an immediate feedback loop, not only for unit but also integrative tests. We’ll see how container orchestration and service meshes support our tests regarding distributed applications.\n\nOne of the key aspects will be how to write maintainable test code with high quality that embraces principles of software craftsmanship. All of the time will be spent live-coding typical test cases with different scopes using different technologies. While Sebastian will be focusing on Jakarta EE, the concepts and approaches hold true for all enterprise Java projects.",

This approach is easy enough to be done correctly by a novice software engineer, however, it has low scalability and is subject to large latencies.\r\n\r\nApart from being resilient to failures, lock-free and wait-free data structures can have a better latency profile, but it takes significant expertise to implement or modify them to suit specific application needs.

Big Data streaming math operations can commonly include millions to billions of streaming key reads & writes, and this volume is handled fast and gracefully while maintaining exact semantics.\n\nHowever, the best and fastest K/V operation is purely local.

    "content": "How java.util.concurrent.SynchronousQueue and java.util.concurrent.Exchanger work, and why you should care if you write multithreaded code.Synchronized blocks in Java allow multithreaded programs to coordinate access to shared data structures. Their performance can suffer, however, if the operating system preempts a thread that is holding the lock on a synchronized object. Nonblocking data structures avoid this problem with clever algorithms (based on atomic variables) in which no thread ever waits for another.\n\nThis talk will present the notion of _dual_ data structures, which also support condition synchronization. When expected conditions are met, a dual data structure works like any other nonblocking structure. It also avoids contention when threads must wait (e.g., for data to be added to a currently empty queue), and guarantees immediate wakeup when the wait is over. When dual queues were used (in the Java SE 6 release) to replace the original semaphore-based code in java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor, performance improved by about a factor of 10.",

Systems where NVRAM co-exists with (or even replaces) traditional volatile main memory have recently become commercially available and are anticipated to become increasingly widespread in the future. Consequently, there is growing interest in recoverable concurrent objects (also called persistent or durable objects) — concurrent objects that leverage state saved in NVRAM for efficient recovery from crash failures.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will describe emerging shared-memory models for recoverable objects, as well as algorithms for implementing recoverable versions of mutual-exclusion locks and lock-free concurrent objects.",

    "content": "This talk will discuss how to solve the consensus problem in the case where some processes of a distributed message-passing system may exhibit a Byzantine behavior.More and more applications are now distributed and in non-trivial distributed applications, it appears that the computing entities (processes) have to agree in one way or another, for example, to take a common decision, execute specific actions, or validate some commitment. The most famous distributed agreement problem is the consensus problem. A process crash failure occurs when a process stops prematurely; it can be seen as a benign failure, as a crashed process did not pollute the computation before crashing. The situation is different with Byzantine failures. A process has a Byzantine behavior when it arbitrarily deviates from its intended behavior. Let us notice that, from a failure hierarchy point of view, process crashes (unexpected halting) constitute a strict subset of Byzantine failures. As message-passing distributed systems are more and more pervasive, the assumption \"no process has a bad behavior\" is no longer sensible. Hence, agreement in Byzantine message-passing systems is becoming a more and more important issue of fault-tolerance.\n\nThis lecture aims to show how the consensus problem can be solved in both synchronous and asynchronous distributed message-passing systems prone to Byzantine failures. We present some lower bounds on the ratio of Byzantine processes that can be tolerated and how these bounds evolve according to the expected complexity of the obtained solutions. In synchronous systems, we will present the basic consensus algorithm called EIG (exponential information gathering) and show how its exponential complexity can be lowered. In the asynchronous model, consensus cannot be solved deterministically, we will show how to circumvent this impossibility by using timing assumptions or randomization. For this and in order to have more intuitive algorithms, we will introduce a series of broadcast primitives that help reduce the noise due to the Byzantine behavior of part of the processes.",

What is efficiency in the first place? First, we need to choose a complexity metric and agree that the metric is relevant. Second, we need to show that the program performs \"well\", having this metric in mind. Ideally, we would like to show that no program can solve the given problem with a better complexity. How to do it? We need to establish a *tight lower bound*, i.e. (1) find a complexity level that no program can beat, and (2) show that our program exhibits precisely this complexity.\n\nIn this lecture, we discuss popular techniques designed for establishing (tight) lower bounds in distributed computing. Models for distributed systems come in many flavors: processes may communicate through shared memory or by message passing, they may be synchronous or asynchronous, prone to failures or not, and so on. Different models require different lower bound results. Nevertheless, many of these results rely on common techniques, having to do with information transfer and the difficulty of dealing with indistinguishable scenarios.

By ensuring that no reachable state precludes forward progress by any given thread, nonblocking structures avoid performance anomalies in the presence of preemption, and can in principle tolerate thread failures. They can also outperform lock-based alternatives in several important cases, and are competitive in others. They are, however, quite difficult to write — due, among other things, to inherent data races, interactions with the language and hardware memory model, and the need for concurrent memory management.\n\nThis course will briefly survey background material on hardware primitives and memory models, together with formal notions of safety, liveness, and proof techniques.

Where monolithic applications typically offered direct access to extensive monitoring dashbords, such easy overview is no longer available when a multitude of services is connected loosely on a network. But how to keep track of a system of such dynamic state?\n\nDistributed tracing is a method of connecting interaction of different services on a network. Collecting and processing such tracing information again allows for the observation of a distributed system in its entirety. This talk shares the presenter's insights gained by working on the JVM-support of distributed tracing for the APM tool Instana. Doing so, it introduces the landscape of approaches to distributed tracing on the JVM, discussing popular approaches such as Dapper, Zipkin or Brave/OpenTracing. In the process, it is discussed how byte code instrumentation can be used to capture systems without requiring a user to set up the software under observation.

Of course, this security comes at a certain cost and earned Java the reputation of being slow. But current Java implementations are quite smart and can implement many of these checks at virtually zero costs.\n\nUsing small and simple examples, this session will demonstrate how the HotSpot virtual machine implements these features, and the JIT compiler magically optimizes away most of the associated overhead. Volker will also look at corner cases where some of the optimizations may fail.\n\nSafepoints:\n\n- what is a safepoint;\n- why do we need safepoints;\n- what does the VM do at safepoints;\n- how do we reach a safepoint and how can we implement this efficiently;\n- safepoints and JNI/native code (accessing Java objects through handles);\n\nNullPointer checks:\n\n- how can we implement them efficiently or eliminate them;\n- using OS signals and page faults when reading/writing from/to 0x0;\n- problems with compressed oops (0x0 will be mapped to start of heap);\n- field offset must be smaller than page size for implicit null checks;\n- some platforms (i.e. ppc64) require traps for null checks.\n\nStackOverflow checks:\n\n- stack banging (yellow, red pages, ..);\n- problems when calling to native;\n- JEP 270: Reserved Stack Areas for Critical Sections.\n- If time allows, Volker will also take a look on ArrayBoundChecks.\n\nAs always, Volker will provide some small Java programs and use them to demonstrate the above points from Java down to bytecode and assembler.",

C# programmers start in a very different place. We are comfortable with classes, inheritance and all the aspects of OOP, but are not used to scripting for the web.

But as developers, and especially JavaScript developers, far too often we are placed in the exclusive context of the tasks we solve at this very moment without paying attention to what happens around us, without thinking about how our work will be used in the end product. The modern developer has to be a craftsman: he has to know how to choose material, handle it and present a product, suitable for this particular user or this particular user group.\nDuring this talk Denis will try to set debugger; for yourselves: look around and understand what is going on in the world of our “materials” that we should be using in our work like design, UX, psychology.

When timestamp based conflict resolvers do not work, CRDT is a cure.A bunch of DCs with asynchronous replication and coordination-avoidance; high availability and partition tolerance; zero latency on client with optimistic UI; offline work in browser or mobile. Sounds cool, doesn't it? There are not so many applications on the market that have all these features. The reason for this is concurrent modifications that lead to conflicts. And you find yourself implementing timestamp-based conflict resolver. But does it really work? Most likely not. Academia has proposed a solution for this problem several years ago — CRDT (Conflict-free replicated datatypes). In this talk Andrey shows why naive conflict resolvers do not work using demo application. Afterwards CRDTs will be presented as the problem solution. Attendees will learn different CRDT types, advantages and disadvantages of each type will be discussed. Also this talk will shed a light on problems that are not solvable with CRDTs.

However, while the javac compiler is guaranteed to produce correct Java byte-code, shifting down to the byte-code level requires that you keep track of its correctness yourself. Otherwise, there is a chance to get a j.l.VerifyError at run time upon the loading of a generated class, because the JVM passes all classes through the Java byte-code verifier to enforce strict correctness requirements. Therefore, knowing just the semantics of Java byte-code instructions is often not enough to properly synthesize classes — you also need to know how the Java byte-code verifier works, what byte-code it deems correct, and what it does not.\n\nIn this talk, Nikita will tell what mission the Java byte-code verifier carries out in the JVM, when and how it works, whether it may affect the performance of your application, and why it turning it off is so dangerous.",

During the talk we will fix bugs, edit configs, calculate resource usage and weep.Lots of people know how to use Hadoop/Spark for generating reports, but lately there’s an increasing number of clients asking for real-time processing of big data streams (as opposed to merely saving them to S3 or Cassandra for future reports which take hours to generate). It’s often required to calculate “on the fly” some aggregated values for a short period of time and filter a stream to decrease a load on the subsequent calculation stages.\nIt’s common to see projects where the team organize a “lake of data” in Amazon, just dropping all the incoming events in Kafka. Is Spark able to manage all the streams from Kafka? If so, at what cost and what can be used to help it?\nDon’t expect an introduction to Spark and RDD or some blah-blah about Big Data.

Numerous flavors of SSE & AVX on x86, VIS on SPARC, NEON on ARM, AltiVec on Power, which differ in many aspects. Such variance makes it notoriously hard to utilize all available computational power in cross-platform manner.\nJava is one of the most popular programming languages in today’s software development and it is well-known as a first class cross-platform computing environment. State-of-the-art JVMs (e.g., HotSpot) do a good job at automatically detecting implicit parallelism and generating vectorized code for Java programs, but it is limited. There are use cases when a specialized API is needed and they were overlooked until recently.\nAs part of Project Panama, different ways to bring the benefits of vector/parallel computation capability into Java platform are explored. One of them is library-based Java API (called Vector API) which efficiently maps to hardware and aids developers to explicitly expose the programs’ data parallelism.

No mutants should survive ever. If they are, then either the test is bad, or the function is not correct.\n\nResearch in this area exists since 70's. However, this method is not widely adopted.

As compared to Dagger 2, Toothpick provides more powerful testing support, allowing you to leverage DI to mock dependencies using either mockito or easymock.\n\nIts explicit scope tree helps developers to build more robust apps.

Mobile devs have been without tools like continuous integration and automated testing, which enable delivery of high-quality apps more rapidly. A key piece of the solution for mobile is Appium, an open-source, cross-platform, language-agnostic mobile automation framework you can use to write automated UI tests for Android and iOS apps (native, hybrid, web), to be run on emulators or devices. In this talk Dan along with an audience will explore the philosophy that underlies the work behind Appium, including the open-source nature of Appium’s diverse, active and friendly community. Then, after a brief explanation of the technology that powers Appium, Dan will move into the technical portion of the talk, where attendees will see easy it is to write Appium scripts using the WebDriver protocol in their favorite language.",

This talk is a travel diary of the years spent looking for a different, non Hollywood-way to scale security testing.As anyone involved in testing knows, all the challenges in this space have been solved long ago. If we still have bugs, it’s only because engineers are lazy: existing practices and technologies can surely catch all issues, if properly applied. Finally, security bugs are just bugs, ergo security testing is also a solved problem for non-lazy engineers.\n\nIn this talk I’ll try to debunk this blatant lie, looking at some of the lessons I’ve learnt dealing with security testing in an uncomfortably large infrastructure. After demonstrating that security testing is a full citizen of testing practices and not a weird alien, I’ll trace my journey in building security testing tools at Google.\n\nSpoiler alert: There won’t be any Hollywood style root-shell-and-ride-off-into-the-sunset moment: security testing at scale is a trench war, not a walk in the park. In a surprising turn of events, I’ll also cover the things that did not quite work and those that did not work at all, because sometimes failures are even more interesting than victories.\n\nIf you care about in-the-trenches security, are curious about the tiny details that can derail an initiative, or need to worry about security testing web software or infrastructures, then you might find this talk interesting.\nYou'll walk away with some insights on strategies for web security testing that are not regular penetration testing.",

The problem of scene recognition in these images is much more complicated than the object recognition problem, which is rather well-studied and already used in the industry. The main reason for it being that is that a scene is a more complex and a less formalized concept: it is quite difficult to mark out the characteristics that describe such concepts as a restaurant, a kitchen, a sport event and so forth.

We will learn about the utilities an extension can use, e.g. how it should store state, so you will be ready to write your own extensions after this session.Attention! To fully understand everything Marc will tell us in this talk, we strongly encourage you to watch his previous talk \"JUnit 5 — The New Testing Framework for Java and Platform for the JVM\": \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=751gMXH-lEE \n\nJUnit 5 has finally arrived! It introduces a completely new extension model that allows to customize almost every aspect of test execution. \n\nFor example, it lets you define custom conditions to decide whether a test should be executed or skipped. Test lifecycle callbacks allow to encapsulate common setup/teardown code in an extension. An extension can pass values or inject dependencies to a test by post-processing test instances, or resolving test method parameters. Moreover, you can even write an extension that specifies how a test method becomes a template for multiple tests and how to invoke those, e.g. multiple times with different parameters or a different setup. \n\nIn this talk, we will go on an example-driven tour of the new extension API using real-world testing scenarios. We will learn about the utilities an extension can use, e.g. how it should store state, so you will be ready to write your own extensions after this session. \n\nThe talk will be interesting for experienced Java developers with prior knowledge of JUnit (at least JUnit 4)",

How would we run our own things and businesses? Let us tell you a story, a fiction story, perhaps a science fiction story. Or rather software fiction story. Back in 2008 a guy created Bitcoin. To run Bitcoin, a general ledger was necessary — Blockchain. Blockchain is a public ledger for transactions — potentially, any types of transactions. Imagine someone taking this further, one level or two further. Blockchain will rock the world as we know it from the foundation. Banks, notaries, public authorities, institutions — any 3rd party trust authority — much more than regular industry companies will be on the brink of disaster. Imagine in 2048 a world entirely based on Blockchain where every transaction is tracked, open, and verifiable by everyone. Imagine a world in which everyone dresses RFID tags and is connected to the Blockchain. Your steps are tracked (well, much of it happens today too!), your position is known, your actions are recorded. Imagine a world in which computers carry on most of boring tasks of life — making decisions for you, driving cars for you, booking flights for you, buying things for you, writing much of the software for you. Imagine a world in which only thoughts and dreams are yours and only pleasant things. (No, we don't expect computers having sex on behalf of you, not even in 2048!) Would it be a dystopia or utopia? A world without fraud, jealousy, crime. A world full of honesty, freedom, love, and the two things together (yes, free-love much of what hippies tried with sex in the 70s). Time will tell, but time flies. Unchain your heart, let it set you free.",

However, while the javac compiler is guaranteed to produce correct Java bytecode, shifting down to the bytecode level requires that you keep track of its correctness yourself. Otherwise, there is a chance to get a j.l.VerifyError at runtime upon the loading of a generated class, because the JVM passes all classes through the Java bytecode verifier to enforce strict correctness requirements. Therefore, knowing just the semantics of Java bytecode instructions is often not enough to properly synthesize classes — you also need to know how the Java bytecode verifier works, what bytecode it deems correct, and what it does not.\n\nIn this talk, Nikita will tell what mission the Java bytecode verifier carries out in the JVM, when and how it works, whether it may affect the performance of your application, and why turning it off is so dangerous.",

They had many handmade configurations mixed with business logic; they even were using copy-paste techniques. They wrote many lines of the same ugly code, which sometimes worked, and sometimes not, but they understood everything they did (mostly). They could easily use debug in order to find a problem and solve it. \n  \nAnd then Spring happened and things have changed… We received a lot of magic from Spring black box and our code became much cleaner and more simple. Business aspects became apart from other technical aspects and configuration code, but debug became more complicated. After we learned how Spring is working we know how to debug our code and solve more complicated problems (mostly). \n  \nAnd then Spring Boot happened… \n  \nOn the one hand, it solved thousands of problems: versions conflict, configuration issues, infrastructure's beans declarations, problems with environments, and even running or deploying applications including building jar/war… On the other hand, Spring Boot uses so much magic that mostly we come across two scenarios: \n  \n1. Everything is working without any effort even though nobody knows why. \n2. Nothing is working and nobody knows why. \n  \nIn this talk we will try to reveal at least part of Spring Boot magic by discovering Spring Boot concepts, conventions and the way it works. And even though after this talk you will understand that there is no magic (mostly) you will enjoy Spring Boot even more, because you will be able to solve Spring Boot problems or conflicts without calling 911 (mostly).",

The peak throughput of 325,000 transactions per second is 85% more than that in 2016. Most of these business-critical transactions are handled by hundreds of thousands of Java applications, written in more than a billion lines of code.

The answer is simple: the industry develops if new solutions continuously appear. \nNowadays there are many tools for UI test automation. The most popular for Java are Selenide, JDI, Serenity BDD and HtmlElements. Each one of them has its own way, its own advantages, and disadvantages. \n\nHistorically we’ve been using HtmlElements for our projects, but it is not up-to-date anymore.

Quite often it does, and these issues are hard to find even with the help of unit tests or QA staff. There might be some specific errors in sources such as deadlocks or race conditions related to mistakes made in the design of multi-threaded applications.\n\nOne of the tools which can help QA and programmers in their bug-fighting is a SAST – Static Application Security Testing. It’s a very difficult and complicated system which price is far from being low. Moreover, making such system a part of CI is quite a tricky task. So the right SAST can significantly increase the productivity of QA teams, whereas the bad SAST might drastically decrease it.",

Обеспечение безопасности разрабатываемого ПО — неотъемлемая часть такого процесса. Нужно точно и без отрыва от производства определять и устранять риски безопасности — уязвимости. Но как показывает практика, здесь есть две проблемы. Первая — анализ качества кода ошибочно считают достаточной мерой для проверки ПО в том числе на риски безопасности. Вторая — те, кто понимает, что этого недостаточно, и прибегает к инструментам анализа защищенности, сталкиваются с трудностью: мало просто найти уязвимости, их нужно верифицировать (подтвердить, что это не ложное срабатывание), ведь только в этом случае уязвимость можно исправить. Усугубляет проблему тот факт, что верификация в большинстве случаев делается вручную, а с учетом того, что число уязвимостей может достигать сотен и тысяч, не просто эффективность, но сама целесообразность поддержки процесса CI/CD оказывается под большим вопросом.\r\n\r\nВ своем докладе Алексей расскажет, как сделать так, чтобы в реалиях непрерывности процесса, больших объемов и горящих дедлайнов дефекты безопасности не остались незамеченными, а процесс их верификации не превратился в бутылочное горлышко.

In the session we will look at these possibilities — how and why we can do it. We'll find out exactly where to start writing your own GC and whether it is difficult or not. We will also look at less flexible but still powerful possibilities of GC customization when CLR Hosting is being used.\n\nThe target audience should be interested in advanced memory management topics, as session will be concentrated on the GC customization and GC algorithms in general.

With a budget of 16.6ms per frame, a game has to perform lots of complex calculations in different programming domains including physics, rendering, audio, machine learning. \n\nWe believe that .NET and specially C# for games can provide a fantastic balance between productivity, safety and performance. But for certain critical code, we know also that C# is currently not able to deliver the performance that some games are looking for. \n\nIn order to lower the gap between the performance of C# games versus a more optimized language like C++, and even to go beyond what we can achieve with C++, we have been developing for the past year at Unity Technologies the \"burst\" compiler: a solution to compile a subset of the C# language to highly optimized native code using the LLVM compiler infrastructure. \n\nIn this talk, we will go through the details behind this challenge and how we were able to unlock it: \n\n- The challenges of generating better native code from IL/.NET than existing solutions like RyuJIT \n- The subset of the C# language used to maximize the performance \n- How to allow auto-vectorizing IL code? \n- Using data-oriented programming in C# without a GC \n- Integrate dedicated optimizations for mathematic functions \n- Developing an automatic Structure-Of-Array (SOA) approach into the compiler \n- How much difference between JIT and AOT in this solution? \n\nAttendees will learn about Unity Technologies' approach to deliver a new JIT/AOT compiler for a subset of the C# language to unlock performance in games. \n\nThe target audience consists of people interested in low-level optimizations, native code generation, compilers, IL bytecode, .NET JIT and AOT, and LLVM.",

For every greenfield progressive web app with 100% test coverage, there are literally hundreds of archaic line-of-business applications running in production — systems with no tests, no documentation, built using out-of-date tools, languages and platforms. It's the code developers love to hate: it's not exciting, it's not shiny, and it won't look good on your CV — but the world runs on legacy code, and, as developers, if we're going to work on anything that actually matters, we're going to end up dealing with legacy. To work effectively with this kind of system, we need to answer some fundamental questions: why was it built this way in the first place? What's happened over the years it's been running in production? And, most importantly, how can we develop our understanding of legacy codebases to the point where we're confident that we can add features, fix bugs and improve performance without making things worse?\n\nDylan worked on the web application stack at Spotlight (www.spotlight.com) from 2000 until 2018 — first as a supplier, then as webmaster, then as systems architect. Working on the same codebase for nearly two decades has given him an unusual perspective on how applications go from being cutting-edge to being \"legacy\".\n\nIn this talk, he'll share tips, patterns and techniques that he's learned from helping new developers work with a large and unfamiliar codebase.

Developers get an opportunity to run tests on new version of their service and stable production versions of the rest, and also additional confidence before deploying into production.\n\nThis talk's aimed at people who are interested in microservices or work with them. The former will learn about concepts existing in this area, present problems and their solutions. The latter could get some new ideas on how to make their own lives easier, deploy into production faster and more often and suffer fewer problems.",

The standard C++ iostreams have been criticized for being difficult to use due to their statefulness and slow due to runtime polymorphism. Despite its age, printf is still popular because of simplicity and speed. The Boost library offers two more alternatives, Boost.Format and Boost.LexicalCast. And finally, the P0645 standard proposal sponsored by Facebook is currently finding its way through the C++ committee. All these approaches are still firmly based on standard containers and iterators. But the Standard Library is changing radically with the advent of ranges, range adaptors and functional style programming in C++. Generating optimized code with metaprogramming is becoming standard fare. \n\nIn this talk, Valentin intends to convince you that the combination of ranges with a bit of metaprogramming makes for a very elegant solution to the text formatting problem. He introduces a form of ranges with internal iteration, which are generating their elements one by one rather than exposing external iterators. You can use these generator ranges to represent the values to be formatted, conceptually turning them into lazily evaluated strings. These can be used just like regular strings are used today: in function returns; as standard algorithm input; embedded into other, equally lazily evaluated strings; and so on, before they are finally expanded for display. By choosing the right interfaces, you can optimize this expansion at compile-time, making it no less pretty to write, but more efficient to expand than any text formatting approaches that rely on format strings that must be parsed at runtime. Valentin believes that this approach is the natural extension of a range-based future standard library to text formatting.",

Despite lots of information accumulated through the years (including speeches given by world-class experts), among the application developers (those who do not fall asleep cuddling up to the standard every night) there still isn't clear understanding on what exactly C++20 concepts are and do we really need them when we've got good old enable_if. Part of the blame is on concepts' evolution in 15 years (Concepts Full + Concept Map -> Concepts Lite), and part is on their dissimilarity to the corresponding tools in other languages (Java/С# generic bounds, Rust traits, ...).\n\nThis talk will begin with a brief overview of concept-related changes in C++20. Then we'll explore implementation of several STL classes and functions, comparing C++17 и С++20 solutions. For example:\n- to implement std::optional, today we have to use inheritance hierarchy with a depth of 7. In C++20, there will be no need for that;\n- for the default constructor std::pair today two template functions are required, in C++20 — one non-template;\n- template classes often have partial specialization; if template parameters have some special properties, it is easier and more correct to use concepts.\n\nThe audience is expected to have basic understanding of concepts and SFINAE. Knowledge of C++ standard library will also be useful, but you don't need to know all the implementation intricacies and details.",

Don't believe it? Come and see!The C++ elites have been talking for years about value semantics, immutability, and sharing by communicating. A better world without mutexes, races, observers, command patterns and so more lies ahead! When it comes to doing it in practice, it is not so easy. One of the main problem lies in our data structures...\n\nImmutable data structures don't change their values. They are manipulated by producing new values. The old values remain there, and can be read safely from multiple threads without locks. They provide structural sharing, because new and old values can share common data — they are fast to compare and can keep a compact undo-history. As such, they are great for concurrent and interactive systems: they simplify the architecture of desktop software and allow servers to scale better. They are the secret sauce behind the success of Clojure and Scala, and even the JavaScript crowd is loving it via Facebook's Immutable.js. \n\nWe are presenting Immer, a C++ library implementing modern and efficient immutable data structures. \n\nIn this session, we will talk about the architectural benefits of immutability and show how a very efficient and powerful persistent vector type can be built using state-of-the-art structures (Relaxed Radix Balanced Trees).

Each seem to have different trade-offs, with none being perfect in all cases. \n\nIn C++ we adopted exceptions as the primary mechanism early on, and the standard library uses them extensively. \n\nYet many — 52% according to last year's Standard C++ Foundation survey — ban exceptions in all, or part, of their codebases! \n\nRecently there has been a lot of interest in using ADTs (Algebraic Data Types) such as 'std::optional', or the proposed 'std::expected', for error handling. There are definitely advantages here, but we're still not quite there yet. Can we do better? \n\nWe start by summarizing the material from Phil's earlier talk, \"Option(al) is not a failure\", which surveys existing error handling approaches and scores them against each other, leading up to the new proposal, p0709r1, \"Zero-overhead deterministic exceptions\". We then dig into this proposal in more depth and look at the implications, considering also the supporting proposals, p1028 (std::error) and p1029 ([[move relocates]]) and others. We'll also look at experiences with similar mechanisms in other languages, notably Swift, to get an idea of how it might work out in practice. \n\nIn the end we should have a solid idea of which error handling strategy to use when, what's coming next, and how to approach code now that will play nicely in that possible future.",

The talk is trying to offer a way to move from monolith design to distributed design (microservices). It is based on old design concepts like DDD and SOA and clean code.Software design is hard, maybe the hardest part of building software systems... When designing distributed systems things get even more challenging. Now that microservices are so popular, we all want to decompose our monoliths to smaller units of independent components. If we don't want to end up with a distributed monolith, we need to have a toolbox of design concepts so we can achieve well-defined boundaries between our components groups described as \"services\" and \"service boundaries\" in the service-oriented architecture or SOA paradigm.\n\nThe traditional way of designing systems based on a domain/data model with very complex relationships and dependencies may kind of work when building a monolith, but just breaks apart when you're building distributed systems.\n\nOne of the pillars of distributed system design is to solve the **coupling** problem. In order to achieve this, we need to rethink how we design our components and \"services\". We need to move from monolith thinking to distributed thinking, leaving the single relational data model to multiple vertical bounded contexts that together compose a \"service\" boundary.\n\nIn this talk, Sean will walk you through the process of designing a very simplistic and naive vertical slice, while introducing the concepts from domain-driven design (DDD) and SOA, to build a single vertical. From there you will be able to do your first steps to design a loosely coupled distributed system, and be on the way to find your \"service\" boundaries.",

But then microservices showed that if architects build evolvability into the architecture, change becomes easier. This talk, based on Neal's upcoming book, investigates the family of software architectures that support evolutionary change, along with how to build evolvable systems. Understanding how to evolve architecture requires understanding how architectural dimensions interact; Neal describes how to achieve appropriate coupling between components and services. Incremental change is critical for the mechanics of evolution; Neal covers how to build engineering and DevOps practices to support continuous change. Uncontrolled evolution leads to undesirable side effects; Neal covers how fitness functions build protective, testable scaffolding around critical parts to guide the architecture as it evolves.\n\nThe software development ecosystem exists in a state of dynamic equilibrium, where any new tool, framework, or technique leads to disruption and the establishment of a new equilibrium. Predictability is impossible when the foundation architects plan against changes constantly in unexpected ways. Instead, prefer evolvability over predictability.

He will also cover what this might mean for your organization's broader testing strategy.",

    "title": "Nisan Haramati. Model-driven testing: A property-based approach to end-to-end testing",
    "content": "Applying property-based testing methods to end-to-end tests for distributed data systems and other complex applications.We often joke that the only thing harder than building a distributed system is testing it. And as with most jokes, there is a truth at its core. Distributed systems are difficult to test because their complexity grows in two directions: the complexity of concurrently moving parts is compounded by the unreliability of the distribution medium itself, often leading to failure circumstances that are as difficult to predict as they are to reproduce.\r\n\r\nProperty-based testing is the method of repeated execution of a function over a wide range of (possibly random) inputs in order to find cases where a specified property is violated. It can be further enhanced with a refinement process that minimizes the failing input range. This method is often helpful in discovering earlier the sort of edge-case bugs that would otherwise only crop up in production.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to testing the properties of Wallaroo, a framework for building distributed data applications, the idea of combining property-based testing methods with end-to-end tests seemed liked a natural fit. On the one hand, we can leverage the property-based tests to show that Wallaroo's core properties hold over a broad range of application designs and system events (such as cluster scaling, network errors, and process crashes). And on the other hand, the end-to-end tests help show that these applications do, in fact, work in a variety of real-world conditions.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will focus on the challenges and benefits of using property-based testing in the end-to-end tests of distributed systems like Wallaroo. It will walk through the infrastructure and automation requirements, the signal design theory underpinning the tests, the active cycle of generation-execution-refinement for obtaining minimal reproducing test cases, and finally the results and lessons learned in the process.",

Such variety of compilers naturally brings about projects in which code is reused for different platforms.\n\nStarting from version 1.2, experimental support of these multiplatform projects was added on the syntax level, in regards to tooling. This essentially means that Kotlin developers now can use same code on different platforms, all the while retaining their access to platform-specific API. This is an experimental feature, i.e. an area subject to frequent changes. In Kotlin 1.3 multiplatform project support was reworked significantly, especially on the design model level.\n\nThis talk deals with the concept of multiplatform projects in Kotlin in and of itself as well as changes in this concept since 1.3. So it could be interesting both to those who haven't even heard about this feature and those who already tried it in Kotlin 1.2.\n\nWe'll discuss:\n- what multiplatform projects are essentially, why do we need them and what they enable us to do;\n- how they look like on the part of build systems, what challenges appear there and how we solve them;\n- how to use such projects for Android and iOS apps development.",

In this session, we will discover how FSMs and statecharts can take your UIs to the next level, with innovative techniques for implementing, testing, and visualizing your app's finite states in a robust, automated way, with plenty of use cases, demos, and resources.\n\nFinite state machines are an extremely important topic for any software developer who wants to create robust systems and user interfaces, and they're nothing new: FSMs have been used for over 50 years in applications from electronics to video games. Unfortunately, FSMs are seldom used explicitly when creating user interfaces, because it's much easier to implement UIs from a bottom-up approach, which is adding code inside event handlers that mutate and juggle state when needed.\n\nHowever, this approach means that the entire app flow is inside the mind of the developer, which makes understanding an app's logic difficult to understand, test, and extend when more features are needed. FSMs and statecharts solve this problem elegantly by making the transition between states explicit. David will be presenting an innovative approach to representing these declaratively, which gives developers many advantages:\n- An easily configurable representation of business logic and user flows\n- A way to parse and visualize those state machines\n- Sharing state machines between different languages (!!)\n- Automatically generating comprehensive tests for every single state-to-state flow in your app (never forget a unit/integration test again)\n- Statically analyze and optimize state machines (improved performance and user experience)\n- TypeScript can enforce finite states/actions for better developer experience.",

Pavel will describe and show what GraphQL is by simple words, not like in the documentation.\n\nSpeaker will tell what parts of GraphQL server consist of. For what GraphQL is responsible and what has to be implemented by the backend developer itself. Pavel will show on a diagram where is GraphQL place along with REST and RPC.\n\nAlso, Pavel will demonstrate several ways to request data from GraphQL server.\n\nThere will also be information about why feature-packed GraphQL clients are needed. How they allow forming GraphQL requests without mistakes, how can cleverly send requests to the server, caching answers and work remotely? Once, after working with Relay and ApolloClient, you'll remember Redux like a bad dream.\n\nGraphQL is an ideal companion for the modern component approach and allows to take the development of client application to a new level. \n\nPeople, who have already seen Pavel's talks about GraphQL and is waiting for something new are asked not to be disappointed — the talk is aimed at newbies and skeptics, both for back-end and front-end developers.",

Unfortunately, many developers lack experience in protocol design and make common mistakes. This talk is a crash course in designing TCP/IP protocols, with a focus on always-on, low-latency device communication.\n\nTCP/IP communication mistakes are common because of how the TCP/IP protocol is presented: most developers learn about TCP/IP along with the rest of the OSI networking stack, but the concepts of the lower network stack layers do not carry through to the TCP/IP level. In fact, many early internet protocols including HTTP and FTP were designed with some common mistakes; newer protocols such as HTTP/2, WebSockets, and Passive FTP fix those mistakes.\n\nThis talk covers what TCP/IP actually provides to your application, and how to communicate over raw sockets. The three pillars of protocol design are covered: connections, message framing, and keepalives. Various protocol styles are examined, with the pillars evaluated for each, including command/response, polling, and streaming.\n\nYou will leave this talk with enough knowledge to use TCP/IP sockets to communicate with any custom device in a fully reliable manner.

Features such as state management for services, communication using publish/subscribe messaging and event-driven binding to cloud resources might be needed. Dapr introduces a runtime to offer such building blocks, and is less invasive in your application, allowing you to pick-and-choose what you need. \n\nIn this session we will look at the approach that the Dapr runtime takes with a sidecar architecture, separating application logic from the Dapr runtime components. You will also see what it takes to develop distributed applications in .NET Core using Dapr's features and how to bind to messaging infrastructure, cloud resources, and use the actor programming model and client proxies. In the end, you know what it takes to combine Dapr in your ASP.NET Core applications using routing, controllers, or using gRPC clients.",

Такие инструменты прекрасны по сравнению с «сырым» HTML/CSS, но в действительности весьма примитивны. Kotlin — язык программирования общего назначения, в который не встроено никакой поддержки веб-программирования. Однако набор абстракций, предоставляемых в Kotlin, даёт возможность вывести эту область на совершенно другой уровень, где весь HTML/CSS статически типизирован, подлежит повторному использованию и вообще дисциплине программной инженерии.\n\nОдной из первых попыток реализовать этот подход является фреймворк Kara, одновременно ставший одним из первых продуктов, написанных на Kotlin за пределами JetBrains (и России). Kara предоставляет типизированные билдеры (type-safe builders) для HTML/CSS, а также типизированный роутинг (отображение URL на конкретные сервлеты, генерация ссылок и пр.).

Многие технологии «распределённых объектов», разрабатывавшиеся в то время, не дожили до наших дней, и некоторые отголоски этих мёртвых идей можно еще откопать в дизайне Java-сериализации.

Unsafe is meant to be an API internal to the JVM but since it turned out to be extremely powerful, more and more frameworks have used it.\n\nThis talk will show different usecases of sun.misc.Unsafe. Some are commonly used in production environments like fast Serialization, Offheap or to build lock-free algorithms, some not suitable for production but fun to play with breaking the rules of what you can do in Java.\n\nAfter the talk you’ll understand what is possible and what might help you, but not to forget, this talk is given with a big warning: Don’t Try That At Home!",

Sometimes it’s useful that the operating system is beneath the JVM – we can, for example, use operating system thread directly. Other times, however, this is not a good thing. We want the same control of the machine in userland from the JVM as the OS has only in kernel land.\n\nThis has led to the boundary between the OS and the JVM becoming blurry.

An app that translates photos of road signs to other languages? A Web site that automatically deletes inappropriate photos uploaded to it? An app that alerts the marketing department if tweets referencing your company suddenly turn negative? Or an app that uses facial recognition to admit people into buildings or quantify the emotion on the faces of a group of people in a photo or a video frame? AI enables all of these scenarios and more, but the models used to make it happen are too sophisticated (and too compute-intensive) for the average software developer to train on their own.

Если раньше это делалось при помощи набора различных хуков, то после перехода на OSGI изменения стали проводиться «естественным» образом, так как сама эта технология предназначена для разработки не «монолитных» решений, а модульных, состоящих из набора модулей (плагинов).",

If available, they can lead to consistency problems if they are implemented differently in the interpreter and the JIT compilers. Finally, they can change the program control (e.g. safepoint behavior) and observability (e.g. profiling, instrumentation) in subtle ways.\n\nThis talk will give an overview of the intrinsics currently available in the HotSpot VM.

Все примеры будут реализованы для новой серии Samsung 2014 года.\n\nВо время доклада слушатели узнают:\n\n- Что находится «под капотом» Smart TV?\n- Что может понадобиться для начала разработки?\n- Как «подружить» мобильное приложение и SmartTV?\n- Типовые задачи и их решения (схемы, примеры кода, демо-приложения):\n  - быстрый и эффективный поиск всех SmartTV в одном сетевом сегменте с мобильным устройством\n  - передача и упаковка данных на SmartTV и на другие мобильные устройства (SmartTV будет использоваться как proxy)\n- «Нетиповые задачи» и их решения:\n  - установка приложения на SmartTV в пару кликов на мобильном устройстве, если пользователь не знает, что такое SmartHub и что за кнопки на пульте ДУ\n  - правильный подход к установке соединения между SmartTV и мобильным устройством (да-да, мы должны учесть каждое исключение в коде и каждое сообщение об ошибке)\n- Ну и наконец, как можно просто и быстро опубликовать приложение в Smart Hub\n\nВ итоге после доклада вы сможете самостоятельно написать приложение для SmartTV, отладить его и запустить на эмуляторе или на настоящем устройстве! Вы также будете лучше ориентироваться в спектре смежных технологий и потратите существенно меньше времени на дальнейшее вхождение в предметную область за счет концентрированного и наглядного материала.",

There’s a missing link between what DDD is and how it is perceived by most people. DDD is not exactly the thing that it seems to be after you read the Evans’s blue book from cover to cover for the first time. While DDD teaches a set of practices to build a software system, it has little to do with the actual implementation details of such a system. DDD expresses its full potential in the analysis of the system and helps immensely in the discovery of the top-level architecture.

Built with the database persistence in mind, Entity Framework has never been sold for what it actually is—a plain simple O/RM. It makes a point of letting you use classes to express the domain and then persist it. This approach makes for intriguing demos at conferences but may not work as smoothly in the real world. And has little to do with domain-driven design and domain modelling. The point is not in how you write classes and partition logic around database tables. The point is how you organize the business rules and how you save, alter and read back the state of the system. Through a comprehensive and quite interactive example, the session will try to make two key points. A single model doesn’t fit all sizes of applications and the domain model is a quite a different thing that the persistence model that Entity Framework Code First is all about.",

This talk will walk you through our experience of horizontally scaling the CI workload for Red Hat 3scale API Management solution. We will cover parallel test execution, dealing with flaky tests, and a set of principles you should always follow to keep your test codebase healthy.If your Continuous Integration pipeline is slow, you are basically wasting money! A CI pipeline is an essential tool for any modern development team, as the necessary quality assurance mechanism that ensures they can deliver working software. Slow, (or, worse, broken) pipelines cause serious impediment to development teams, and this impediment directly translates into wasted $$$. \n\nInstead, CI should be very much treated like any other production system the company maintains. Whereas the customer-facing systems bring revenue into the company, the CI pipeline ensures the development teams remain productive and efficient in serving the former. \n\nFrom this talk, you can expect to pick up some tips on how to speed up your CI pipelines, by hearing how we did it for the Red Hat 3scale CI. You'll learn how to tackle the ever-growing problem of flaky tests. You'll take with you a set of principles that will keep your test codebase healthy!\nThis will help you reach shorter feedback loops in the development cycle, and — therefore — a more efficient use of your (dev team's) valuable, and expensive, time.  \n\nAnd for the cherry on top, you will probably be reducing your CI costs doing this!",

To meet these ambitious goals they have decided to remove old and deprecated API’s. This means they have started all over with a completely new unified stack. This new stack is not just a replacement for the ageing System.Web.dll assembly. Instead they are all in and are even including a completely new CLR named CoreCLR. This CoreCLR is optimized for cloud hosted applications. As a final twist this new CoreCLR is no longer tied to just Windows.

Subsequently, everything must be redesigned to play well with the cloud. Add to this that the web platform-well-known ASP.NET-is fifteen years old and never experienced a substantial redesign. Same is for .NET. What we know as ASP.NET Core initially started to be just the “cool new version of ASP.NET” but along the way it turned into just one face of the new foundation.

    "title": "Mikhail Novikov. Easy APIs with GraphQL",
    "content": "Когда мы пишем приложения, особенно веб, обычно мы получаем данные с API. Часто это будет REST API. REST — это красиво, но при разработке он начнет мешать, так как немного вьюшек можно нарисовать данными из одного ресурса, и обычно разработчик использует связанные данные из нескольких источников. Как правило, в такой ситуации в API добавляют разворот вложенных данных. Потом еще один. Потом еще пару параметров. А потом поверху всего этого накручивается возможность выбора датасета. В конечном итоге выходит толстенный эндпоинт, разработчик бекенда вас ненавидит, и в какой-то момент вы все равно будете вызывать несколько эндпоинтов со своего фронтенда.\n\nПриложение усложняется и тормозит. Таким образом, любой проект с REST API вырождается в либо толстый и глючный бакенд, либо толстый и глючный фронтенд. А обычно и в то, и в то.\n\nНо решение есть. В 2015 году Facebook представил GraphQL — новый подход к API, который они активно используют в продакшене. GraphQL — это стандарт из двух частей: язык для описания возможностей сервера и язык запросов к серверу на их основе. С помощью GraphQL можно одним запросом взять все данные, которые нужны вам для вьюшки. GraphQL-запрос проверяется на основе схемы и позволяет доставать только нужные (в том числе вложенные) данные. Если нужно что-то еще, достаточно добавить это в запрос, при этом не нужно беспокоить бакендера. В итоге запросы заточены под ваше приложение, а сервер — под доступные данные.\n\nКроме этого, с GraphQL очень удобно оборачивать и совмещать legacy API. Вместо того, чтобы переписывать весь свой старый Drupal магазин, можно поставить перед ним GraphQL Gateway и быстро сделать новое React Native приложение на его основе. GraphQL, а особенно его JS-имплементация graphql-js, позволяет делать API, независимые от источника, быстро и удобно.\n\nВ докладе я расскажу подробно про GraphQL, как с его помощью быстро и эффективно делать удобные API.",

The intro will explain the main design decisions will give practical examples for starting with Vaadin.\n\nVaadin is a web application framework for Rich Internet Applications (RIA). In contrast to Javascript libraries and browser-plugin based solutions, it features a robust server-side architecture. This means that the largest part of the application logic runs securely on the server. The fine-grained component architecture together with statically typed Java language and data binding features help you build applications that are easily modularized and refactored as needed.\n\n2) Creating reusable web components — i.e. adding your favorite feature into Vaadin.\n\nWe talk best practices for designing reusable web components. During the presentation we review all the steps for building a new user interface component starting from an early idea up to packaging and distributing the component. The component is prototyped in HTML and JavaScript, implemented Google Web Toolkit and Vaadin.",

    "content": " Написание программного обеспечения, работающего под большими нагрузками и обрабатывающего большие объемы данных, — это искусство, требующее настоящего умения, независимо от выбранного для реализации языка программирования. Большая часть техник и подходов, используемых в современном HighLoad, следует из здравого смысла и глубокого понимания архитектуры современных серверов.\n\nПлатформа Java имеет массу особенностей, которые, с одной стороны, делают её идеальным выбором для создания больших и сложных систем, но, с другой стороны, заставляют искать специфические подходы и шаблоны для написания высокопроизводительного кода. Этот доклад будет посвящён выделению объектов и сборке мусора, структурам данных и особенностям объектной модели Java, преимуществам и недостаткам компиляции машинного кода «на лету» — в общем, всему тому, чего нет в языках низках уровня типа C и C++ и что необходимо понимать и учитывать при реализации высоконагруженных систем на Java.\n\nДоклад будет сделан на основе опыта, который был накоплен при создании и поддержки компанией <a href=\"http://www.devexperts.com\" target=\"_blank\">Devexperts</a> сервиса доставки рыночных данных в режиме реального времени под торговой маркой <a href=\"http://www.dxfeed.com\" target=\"_blank\">dxFeed</a>. Помимо прочего, dxFeed является поставщиком данных от <a href=\"http://www.opradata.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OPRA</a>, обработка потоков данных которой потребует пропускную способность более 12М сообщений в секунду, при входящем потоке данных более 3Gbps уже к июлю этого года.\n\nВ тоже время, сервис dxFeed ориентирован на крупные финансовые компании, большая часть инфраструктуры которых обычно написана на языке Java. Поставщик данных, который на 100% использует технологии Java на всем пути их получения, нормализации, обработки, и доставки конечным клиентам, является наиболее подходящим для таких компаний в технологическом плане, при условии что выполняются все функциональные и нефункциональные требования.\n\nВажной частью любого технологического решения является стоимость его создания и поддержи. Без учета этих факторов просто невозможно осознанно говорить о выборе той или иной технологии, о том или ином подходе, шаблоне и т.п. в рамках выбранной технологии. Безусловно, наибольшую пропускную способность и наименьшие задержки для любой задачи обработки данных можно обеспечить написав весь код в машинных кодах на ассемблере или, еще лучше, разработав специальный чип, решающий поставленную задачу на аппаратном уровне. Такого рода решения не будут обсуждаться в этом докладе.\n\nДоклад будет сконцентрирован на тех решениях и подходах, которые, исходя из реального опыта, позволяют достичь разумный компромисс между производительностью и сложностью, что во многом и обуславливает выбор платформы Java. Реальное сравнение с классическими поставщиками данных, имеющих десятилетнюю историю развития и поддержки своего программного обеспечения на языках низкого уровня, показывает что особенности Java не являются препятствием к созданию высокопроизводительных систем обработки данных, а скорее наоборот, позволяют догнать и обогнать конкурентов за счет наличия большего инструментария, увеличения продуктивности работы программистов, и упрощения отладки и поддержки.",

It uniquely supports the same configuration, behavior, extensions, analysis tools and supportability features on all these overall 15 platforms.\n\nAs an introduction, this talk will motivate the reasons behind our decision to build and support an own JDK and describe our development model in between the commercial sources we've licensed from Oracle and the OpenJDK project. Following that, our main features like \"Debugging on Demand\" (i.e. start debugging your application without the need to restart it), \"Cloud Debugging\" (i.e. debug your cloud application without any performance or latency problems, be it on your host or on a remote server in the cloud) and our \"SAP JVM Profiler\" which can be attached on-demand without VM configuration will be demonstrated. Apart from that you'll also hear about various smaller productivity features for developers like CPU, memory and I/O traces, extended thread dumps and extended exception messages for critical Java exceptions like for example NullPointer- or ClassCastExceptions.\n\nThe talk will also offer some insights into the implementation details of the before mentioned features.

Сначала использовались обычные подходы параллельной обработки данных на CPU, но стало ясно, что в виде GPU остаётся неиспользованным очень мощный ресурс для подобных расчётов.

Ведь рядом стоит комментарий некислый…\n\n**Реальная история**\n\nНа этом сказка заканчивается и начинается суровая реальность. Спустя 10 месяцев другой программист написал очередной экран под этот сервис и перепутал порядок аргументов (рано или поздно это должно было случиться).\n\nВ результате этой ошибки стоимость полиса упала на 92 процента. QA не заметили дефекта, ведь на сервис никто не смотрел, он существовал уже почти год без изменений. Тестировали только функциональность нового экрана.\n\nКод попал к реальным пользователям и хотя они заподозрили неладное, никто не сообщал о проблеме. Клиенты радовались нереальной скидке, а продавцы получали тучу бонусов за подскочившее количество продаж. В итоге, до конца квартала компания потеряла больше 100 тысяч €. Внимание, вопрос: КТО ВИНОВАТ?\n\nОбычно всё валят на QA. Кто-то может винить безалаберного разработчика экрана. Но прав будет тот, кто скажет, что виноват автор сервиса. Ошибиться может любой, но писать код, который является платформой для дефектов – это непрофессионально.\n\nЧто вы узнаете на тренинге\n\nДанный тренинг отличается от привычных всем тренингов по шаблонам проектирования, он основан на реальных примерах, на чужой боли и суровом опыте. Здесь вы не столкнетесь с нудной теорией, которая редко применяется на практике.\n\nВы будете решать реальные задачи, с которыми сталкивается почти каждый программист. Будут обсуждаться как правильные, так и неправильные шаблоны, названия которых будут озвучены только после того, как качественный код будет написан.\n\nС этого тренинга вы унесете чужой жизненный опыт и собственноручно написанный красивый код, которым можно гордиться.\n\n**Детальная программа**\n\n- Принципы правильного кода\n- Java оптимизации + правильный код = хорошая производительность\n- Антипаттерны\n- Switch as anti-pattern\n- Garbage collection + immutable objects\n- Builder\n- Strategy\n- Adapter\n- Template method\n- Iterator\n- Как написать хороший framework\n- Factory\n- Singleton\n- Composite\n- Dependency injection\n- Inversion of control\n- Callback method (Closures)\n- Proxy\n- Decorator\n- Observer\n- Command\n- Chain of responsibility",

The first case is rare, the second costly. Vaadin is also the shortest way for pure Java programmers with few front-end skills to quickly create nice-looking and robust web applications running on the JVM.\n\nAt this workshop you’ll learn how to write web applications with Vaadin effectively. Given that you code only in Java, compile to bytecode you can integrate it easily with Spring, CDI, JDBC, JPA and build rich and robust application with minimum effort.\n\nDuring this workshop I’ll guide you through the steps of development of a typical web application with Vaadin. This application will be a simple Chat application through which we will demo fundamental Vaadin features:\n\n- First, we will some overview over Vaadin Components and Layouts, including sizing and alignment.\n- After that we’ll move forward and architecture the code developed so far to be Object Oriented, then extend that basic application with Screen switching and Notifications.\n- Finally, we will integration with the database and display the result into a table to add more business value into that.\n- If time allows, we’ll add Push features so as to have a feature-complete Chat application.\n\nForget all about JavaScript and all those fancy frameworks that become hype and are replaced after only a couple of months: after the workshop, participants will be able to build professional looking business applications on their own, with only knowledge of Java and Vaadin.\n\nAll that is going to be done within your favourite IDE with Java so you may use all the familiar things like OOP, static typing, refactoring, etc.\n\n**Prerequisites:** the allocated time is limited, so that in order to be as efficient as possible, attendees are expected to prepare their environment for the workshop in advance.\n\nFirst, get Java (preferably 8), Maven and your IDE of choice (Eclipse, IntelliJ or NetBeans). There’s a dedicated Github project page: <a href=\"https://github.com/nfrankel/vaadin7-workshop/\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/nfrankel/vaadin7...</a>.

    "content": "Многие молодые программисты в начале своей карьеры хотят производить продукт бескомпромиссного качества. При этом ключевым является «бескомпромиссность». Из-за этого они сорятся со старшими товарищами, клиентами и пользователями приложения. Как следствие, программисты не любят уже написанный код, потому как там: компромиссы, ссоры, ничего нельзя менять, все плохо, оставь надежду всяк сюда входящий и т.д. Намного приятнее для них писать код «с нуля», где ты сразу все проектируешь и делаешь «на отличненько», но как только проект доходит до пререлизной подготовки плюс вылезают архитектурные «косяки», оказывается, что вот это крутой новый проект безнадежно испорчен и радости уже не приносит.\n\nВ миру, эти безрадостные проекты носят название «легаси». Я работаю с ними уже 15 лет, и я видел множество таких безнадежно испорченных «сирот», за исправление которых обреченный кастомер готов заплатить золотые горы. И он их исправно платит, пока я привожу код брошенных родителями проектов в соответствие с моими морально-этическими нормами.\n\nВ докладе мы поговорим о легаси-проектах и о том, какие возможности они открывают перед вами, как перед специалистами. Я расскажу как не отставать от технологий, как стать супер-спецом, как делать то, что ты хочешь, а не то, что тебя просят. Я покажу как, имея правильный подход к легаси коду, постоянно совершенствоваться и приносить пользу проекту.",

Instead, they have weak memory models which allow more behaviors.</p>\n<p>Such memory models have to balance between performance and guarantees provided to software developers, or, as one may say, the balance is actually between performance and sanity.

To achieve this, it is necessary to maintain two replicas of data specified for the two types of queries. \nHowever, it is challenging to provide a consistent view for the two replicas within a storage system, because the storage system should allow analytical requests to efficiently read consistent and fresh data from transactional workloads and also scale to large data sizes with high availability.<br>To solve this problem, we propose a Raft-based HTAP database: TiDB. We design a multi-Raft storage system to materialize updates from transactional requests and to synchronize Raft logs with additional nodes that transform row format to column format, forming a column store. \nThis store is dedicated to analytical queries to efficiently read fresh and consistent data. Based on this storage system, we build an SQL engine to process large-scale distributed transactions and expensive analytical queries which optimally read row-format and column-format replicas of data.</p>\n<p>In this talk, Ed will talk about TiDB and its columnar storage engine TiFlash from the perspective of engineering design, and explain how TiDB utilizes and extends Raft protocol to eliminate the impact of OLAP workload on OLTP, to achieve an industrial-grade HTAP database, and give relevant benchmarks and user cases.</p>",

OakMap decreases the memory requirements up to 3 times and experiments show that OakMap is often 2x faster than Java’s state-of-the-art concurrent skip-list. We will discuss OakMap technology and working with the off-heap memory: updating and concurrency.<p>About Oak:\nEfficient ordered in-memory key-value (KV-) maps are paramount for the scalability of modern data platforms. In managed languages like Java, KV-maps face unique challenges due to the high overhead of garbage collection (GC). We present Oak, a scalable concurrent KV-map for environments with managed memory. Oak offloads data from the managed heap, thereby reducing GC overheads and improving memory utilization. An important consideration in this context is the programming model since a standard object-based API entails moving data between the on- and off-heap spaces. In order to avoid the cost associated with such movement, we introduce a novel zero-copy(ZC) API. It provides atomic get, put, remove, and various conditional put operations such as compute (in-situ update). We have released an open-source Java version of Oak. We further present a prototype Oak-based implementation of the internal multidimensional index in Apache Druid. Our experiments show that Oak is often 2x faster than Java's state-of-the-art concurrent skip-list.</p>\n<p>About the Talk:\nThe Oak paper and the talk were part of the PPOPP20 conference (one of the top conferences in parallel programming). The Oak is a combination of practical and academic novelties such as (1) techniques for working with off-heap memory, (2) new zero-copy API, (3) concurrency techniques for maps and off-heap accesses, (4) scalability and performance, (5) backward and forward scanning, etc. Talk may include a further work that was done on Oak since PPOPP20.

На конференциях микросервисы сравнивают с монолитной архитектурой, описывают их плюсы и минусы, делятся успешными и провальными историями. Но, пока в столицах дают рок-концерты, на местах осваивают балалайки. Не всегда понятно, как начать делать систему, основанную на микросервисной архитектуре. Какие проблемы ждут архитектора и разработчиков, какие узкие места могут встретиться и как к этому подготовиться? Имеет ли смысл начинать с монолита или надо сразу разбивать систему на микросервисы? Как определить границы, которые встанут между вашими микросервисами?\n\nВо время разработки можно заложить на будущее множество сложностей, благодаря привычкам, оставшимся после работы над монолитной архитектурой.

It runs a mixture of production and ad-hoc workloads, all within a shared fleet of servers located in a number of geo-distributed datacenters.</p>\n<p>At this scale, storing and handling data efficiently becomes the matter of survival. Also with such a multitude of servers, individual hardware faults are no longer considered anomalies, rather they are regarded as ordinary events happening each day at certain predictable rates.</p>\n<p>Disk drive faults are usually handled via data replication, i.e. making physical copies of the same data piece and placing these copies on a number of machines (typically located in disjoint failure domains such as racks or even whole datacenters). The most common replication factor used nowadays is 3. RF=3 enables losing any two drives simultaneously while preserving data integrity and availability. This, however, incurs x3 overhead in disk storage space.</p>\n<p>Since 2013 we adopted a well-known technique called Erasure Coding, which helps to reduce this overhead factor to lower numbers (such as 4/3) while maintaining the same level of fault tolerance. CPU and network bandwidth consumption, however, are typically higher for Erasure Coding (compared to the usual data replication). Hence designing and scaling such a storage system requires more insights and certain care.</p>\n<p>The standard Erasure Coding approach is directly applicable to immutable data (typically called \"blob chunks\" in YT) \nThe evolution of highly scalable KV-storages (sometimes reaching many PBs in size and consuming tens of GBs of writes per second) prompted us to apply these ideas to so-called \"journal chunks\", i.e. append-only structures used to implement WAL journalling of RAFT-like fault-tolerant data shards.</p>\n<p>We have devised a scheme combining the notions of (read and write) quorums and Erasure Coding to reduce the disk and network bandwidth consumption thus saving on expensive NVME disks and cross-DC traffic while maintaining high throughput and low write latencies, even at higher quantiles.</p>\n<p>In this talk Maxim will give a brief overview of Erasure Coding schemes that we employ and discuss various real-world scenarios and lessons learned while operating these systems at scale.</p>",

We discuss what key challenges WFE solves so that it can be universally applied regardless of the data structure organization.<p>As the number of cores grows, efficient concurrent data structures have become increasingly important because they reduce sequential execution times, and thereby yield scalable performance.</p>\n\n<p>Non-blocking data structures have received particular attention in practice due to their synchronization properties that are relevant in multi-threaded environments, especially their platform-independent progress guarantees — i.e., the ability for threads to make progress without depending on the OS or VM schedulers.\nA number of concurrency libraries for programming languages such as C++ and Java have been developed. However, efficient non-blocking memory reclamation is still a challenge, especially in languages with manual memory management such as C++. In such settings, not only memory has to be safely reclaimed, but also memory usage must remain bounded. Otherwise, memory can be exhausted, which violates progress properties.</p>\n\n<p>Wait-free data structures are critical in latency-sensitive applications, as they offer the strongest progress property: all threads make progress in a bounded number of steps. Although they were historically slower and more tedious to implement than their lock-free counterparts, they are now gaining more traction due to a number of techniques such as Kogan and Petrank's fast-path-slow-path methodology.</p>\n\n<p>Wait-free memory reclamation, until recently, remained a challenge since existing methodologies cannot be directly applied to the memory reclamation problem. One way to address the challenge is to use non-blocking techniques such as Hazard Pointers or Hazard Eras but modify data structures, e.g., use a \"normalized\" Timnat and Petrank's form. The \"normalized\" form guarantees that any operation that does not make progress can be restarted. The process of normalization has several limitations, e.g., requires that only CAS (compare-and-swap) operations are used by data structures. However, there is a growing interest in using specialized instructions such as FAA (fetch-and-add) for which no general normalization methodology exists.</p>\n\n<p>What if there was a more general way to organize reclamation in wait-free data structures regardless of their presentation? A recent algorithm, WFE (Wait-Free Eras), achieves exactly that by extending (lock-free) Hazard Eras.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, we discuss the memory reclamation problem, existing techniques, and how a recent wait-free WFE technique is constructed.

    "content": "In this talk, we will look at the architecture of YugabyteDB that enables it to support all PostgreSQL features along with distributed transactions, resilience, scalability, and geo-distribution of data.PostgreSQL, a single-node RDBMS, is widely adopted for its powerful set of features while being fully open-source RDBMS. However, it is hard to run PostgreSQL as a cloud-native database, which can inherently survive failures, scale horizontally, and be deployed in geo-distributed configurations. Google Spanner is a distributed SQL database that has these features, however, it does not offer the power of PostgreSQL. Combining the best of these two databases would result in a very compelling database. YugabyteDB is a fully open-source distributed SQL database aimed at achieving exactly this goal. \n\nIn this talk, we will look at the architecture of YugabyteDB that enables it to support all PostgreSQL features along with distributed transactions, resilience, scalability, and geo-distribution of data.",

A key challenge that such systems have to address is maintaining data consistency in the presence of concurrent modifications at different nodes and despite inevitable failures. There is a spectrum of consistency models that a system can provide, and navigating it is far from trivial. Strong consistency models give the programmer the illusion that all nodes are always in sync, but hinder system scalability. \nIn contrast, weak consistency models expose the programmer to the effects of replication in exchange for more scalable implementations. We will present modern methods for formally specifying consistency models of distributed systems and reasoning about how their choice affects system correctness. </p>\n<p>References</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/final-printversion-10-5-14.pdf\">Sebastian Burckhardt.

First, unlike many algorithms that require a knowledge of the maximum number N of processes that access the algorithm and require their names to be from the set {1, 2, ... , N}, the MCS algorithm can support an arbitrary number of processes of arbitrary names. Second, the MCS algorithm guarantees that, of the memory references that a process makes while acquiring and releasing the lock, the number of references not satisfied by the cache is bounded by a small constant. Third, the MCS algorithm is also space-efficient: M locks shared by N processes require only O(M+N) words of memory to implement (as opposed to O(MN)).</p>\n<p>However, traditional algorithms, such as MCS, are not fault-tolerant: if the system crashes due to a power outage and subsequently restarts, the processes start over from the protocol's initial configuration. The more attractive alternative of letting the restarted processes \"recover\" their state at the time of the crash and resume from there became a possibility with the recent advent of non-volatile random access memory. In particular, research over the past four years has led to a number of such \"recoverable\" algorithms, but none of them meet the gold standard set by MCS in the sense that they lack at least two of the three properties described above.</p>\n<p>In this course, Prasad will describe the ongoing research that has led to the first recoverable algorithm that meets the gold standard set by MCS.</p>",

Simple implementations often have terrible performance, and making the performance good is challenging.</p>\n<p>In this talk Martin goes beyond the introductory material on CRDTs, and discusses some of the hard-won lessons from years of research on making CRDTs work in practice.</p>",

As a result, we have also taken more time to work on the new version of Vue router and shaping an API that will serve Vue 2 and Vue 3. A more extensible router, easier to contribute, and new architecture from scratch. \nLet's talk about what has changed in the new Router and all the improvements we are bringing.",

However, these queuing systems don’t adequately deliver on the promise of event-driven architectures and often lead to the usage of anti-patterns. The events are carrying both notification and state, which enables developers and data engineers to design and develop to event-driven systems. Developers benefit from the asynchronous communication that events enable between services, and data engineers benefit from the integration capabilities.\n\nIn this talk, Viktor will explain the concepts of events, their relevance to software and data engineers, as well as their power for effectively unifying architectures. You’ll learn how stream processing makes sense in microservices and data integration projects.

Shorter and quicker releases mean your team should not only be able to develop features at the required pace but also test and release them at a sustainable pace. The QA and automation industry has been successful to a decent extent in implementing automated acceptance tests, however, these tests do not guarantee that the look and feel of the application look accurate. Hence, we need to introduce another layer at the top of the pyramid which will validate the UI of the application through automated techniques.\nUser interface plays an important role in the client&#39;s business and some organisations release new features, fancy CSS regularly that support multiple browsers, multiple Operating systems, mobile devices. Verifying the frontend on this browser/device/OS matrix by humans is not only extremely time consuming but also prone to human errors. Testing by humans should primarily focus on discovery and the Usability aspect leaving the repetitive and error-prone tasks to tools. Hence, automating Visual tests is becoming less of an optional activity and more of a must-have activity within the team. Ensuring visually perfect user experiences is equally important as to have the functionality working.</p>\n<p>Main takeaways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The basic concept of automated visual validation tests.</li>\n<li>Challenges involved in automating visual tests.</li>\n<li>How to integrate these tests as part of your CI pipeline</li>\n<li>Good practices associated with automated visual validation tests</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Target audience:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Irrespective of their experience with automating visual tests, this session has something to offer for every audience type.

This talk will be about these possibilities using Jenkins and Gitlab.<p>Nowadays when we are talking about automated test execution we usually consider that is done in the context of Continuous Integration (CI). Usually, QA engineers concentrate on preparing the tests and the test framework, but the CI tools are considered as something where you have to simply plug your tests. Often CI tools are fully owned by DevOps engineers or developers.\nHowever, understanding and skills of work with CI allow QA engineers to significantly improve approaches to test automation.</p>\n<p>Evolution Engineering is using Jenkins — it is a popular open source CI system where lots of functionality developed through plugins. There used to be a lot of manually configured Jenkins builds for regression tests and their support, and the extension was inconvenient, ineffective. Vyacheslav's company implemented Jenkins automation, which made it possible to fully customize it through code. This is also allowed to speed up the creation of new jobs and improve their maintenance. This introduction also fostered the development of CI/CD expertise among QA engineers at Evolution Engineering.</p>\n<p>Now Evolution Engineering is actively moving towards Continuous Delivery (CD) and the old approach with E2E regression tests no longer suits them. One of the most difficult places with great automation needs was the frontend, which is stored in a mono repository, on which about 200 engineers are working. To improve and speed up testing, the team focused on checking specific code changes and integrating automation with the code review process in GitLab. Jenkins has a Gitlab Plugin to provide basic integration, and GitLab also provides a rich API. The team has connected various Jenkins builds (tests and not only) to Merge Requests: they are launched on different events and make sure that the code has been tested well enough. Comments in the Merge Request are used both as an interface for displaying all information on checks and for starting and restarting builds. The result is an ecosystem of automation around the capabilities of Gitlab and Jenkins, in which Evolution Engineering is constantly expanding and improving, and this allows us to release new versions of the game frontend into products daily.</p>",

Ситуация напоминала 1МВ, когда пулемёты и танки уже появились, а понимание новой тактики ещё нет, то есть парадигма в целом императивная. \r\nЗатем в античности настала эпоха ООП на С++. Но рядом появилось множество языков, специально заточенных на ООП в чистом виде.  Сейчас (эпоха постмодерна) в С++ проникает ФП.\r\n\r\nПо каким законам развивается мир программирования, как может язык поочередно от парадигмы к парадигме развиваться, чего ожидать в будущем? Есть ли парадигмы, которые C++ не будет, не может, не должен поддерживать в принципе? Возможен ли специализированный C++ для квантовых компьютеров?",

In practice, we're faced with the fact that it's necessary to execute or continue the execution of some application functionality in the background, while the user switches his attention to others. This can be not only receiving notifications but also maintaining communication with external devices, sending network requests, updating location information, or some kind of synchronization in the background.\r\n\r\nHowever, keeping multiple applications running at the same time is energy-intensive. Apple, to extend the operation of the device, introduces more and more conditions and restrictions which often require a complete rethinking of the current functionality. And the native solutions have many nuances and hidden pitfalls.\r\n\r\nThe developer is required to ensure the correct execution of the functionality of the inactive application, not to conflict with the concept of energy saving in iOS, and to keep within the 30 seconds.

Pavel and Georgy will tell you what problems they have encountered along the way and how they have planned the scope of work.\n\nFirst of all, let's consider working with maps. Let's see what alternative to Google Maps we can choose and how to work with two maps in the application at once. Let's talk about work with push notifications and analyze what Huawei offers us to solve this problem. The speakers will show you what other services Huawei has decided to use and how we can test them.\n\nAs a result, Pavel and Georgy will share the experience of publishing an application in Huawei AppGallery, which consists of the preparation and first impression of the work.",

It encapsulates almost any object that is invocable the right way. `any_invocable` is an even better tool. It can encapsulate some types that `std::function` can't — the ones that are move-only. Unfortunately, it is still invocable in just one way. You get one list of argument types and that's what you must pass.\n\nWhat if the object you want to pass is invocable in more than one way? What if it's `operator()` is a template that you will instantiate with N different types? What if it is a variadic template to which you will pass 0-N arguments? What if you use tag dispatch to do N different things?\nIf you want these things, as well as the type erasure offered by `std::function` and the move-only support offered by `any_invocable`, then `unique_pseudofunction` is the class for you.\n\nFollow the path Filipp took towards realizing that `unique_pseudofunction` is the solution to most problems. We'll break this down into the following steps:\n- building a simple non-generic `any_invocable`;\n- making it generic;\n- adding a small buffer optimization;\n- extending it to support more than one overload of `operator()`.\n\nWe will also look in close detail at several problems solved along the way, and several others that are still unsolved.\nThis talk involves small amounts of C++17 and large amounts of template metaprogramming, function references, and type erasure.",

While we need to improve our testing and fuzzing, we also need another layer of testing: bug detection in production. Production use of \"sanitized\" or \"debug\" builds, which simplify bug detection, is typically prohibitively expensive. GWP-ASan implements a sampling-based approach to bug detection in production.\nSpecifically, GWP-ASan finds heap-use-after-free and heap-buffer-overflow bugs in C/C++ production binaries, with a very low probability per execution, but also with very low overhead. We beat the low probability of bug detection with a large scale of deployment. \n\nIn this talk, we will explain how GWP-ASan works, what it can find, and how to deploy it.

Sebastian would like to share the experiences his team made moving to a cross-platform codebase with students interested in programming, especially those interested in C++.For twelve years, think-cell had been a Windows-only software company and their codebase of approximately 700k lines of code had accumulated many unintentional platform dependencies. Six years ago, the company decided to port their application to the Mac. This change has affected every part of the development process: the project organization, build system, and the way they program in C++ today. \n\nThe commonly used cross-platform libraries such as Qt and boost were good tools to build on, but by themselves were not enough. For many concepts, such as mutexes, semaphores, or shared memory, they only offer a common interface to platform-specific objects with very different semantics and lifetimes. The team wanted light-weight, platform-independent C++ abstractions with identical semantics for rendering, internationalization, file I/O, mouse event handling, RPC calls, and error reporting. Developing these was challenging, firstly, because they had to define which semantics application needed and, secondly, the team had to implement them on each platform. This was not an easy process but Sebastian would argue it has improved the quality of code very much.\n\nBy now, think-cell has moved on to the next challenge and has started to move some functionality to web applications. They wanted to reuse the existing code-base of course, and that meant writing web applications in expressive, type-safe C++. Definitely an advantage in the book! They have built web applications using emscripten, but thanks to a student intern, they generate type-safe C++ bindings, beyond those provided by emscripten, from any TypeScript interface definition. \n\nIn this talk, Sebastian will give you an overview of the C++ abstractions think-cell have implemented, focusing on the cross-platform problem areas where common semantics were hard to define due to limitations of either one of the operating systems, and of course, Sebastian will show you tools that let the company write a web application in C++.",

When data comes in small packages or the job has sub-linear complexity it takes too long to transfer it over the PCI-E bus.\n\nWhat to do? Use SIMD instructions. Most modern processors have them and you have already paid a high price for them. Large registers appeared in the hardware, the CISC-RISC translator increased, the task scheduler became more complicated... And compilers have never learned to substitute complex instructions on their own.

Your team is deploying the code much faster, but data transfer costs are going up as well, aren't they? That's because the size of containers matters the most, and keeping them lightweight means saving on bandwidth usage.\n\nBellSoft's engineers have come up with a solution, which is full-fledged Alpine Linux support in OpenJDK. By that, they have also invented a real-life TARDIS: containers that take only a few MB of storage but carry enormous potential. When JDK 16 is released, the Portola Project will integrate into the OpenJDK mainline within JEP 386. Duct-taping with a glibc layer will become a thing of the past, as all the processes will connect flawlessly. Your company will get to use tiny container images independently of the distribution kit vendor. They have been available for a long time, but the official HotSpot port status for the musl library will expand the scope and simplify related development.\n\nDmitry's talk is going to touch upon the benefits that Alpine Linux is bringing to the OpenJDK community. It will also explain how to optimize Docker images for free by changing just one or two lines of code.

But, with language-agnostic systems for dependency management and work scheduling at its core, it can be used to automate the build process for any kind of software product. Furthermore, it can do this very effectively by providing various caching mechanisms that also work in a language-agnostic way. This makes Gradle a powerful tool to structure and build growing software projects. And, if used correctly, profit from all the optimisations, like incremental and cached builds, even for custom build logic.\r\n\r\nThe challenge though is to understand which features of Gradle to use when and for what.

Much of the work which inspired this concurrency model was conducted in the 1970s but largely forgotten due to chip architectures being single cored in nature.\n\nBut things changed recently, now multi-core CPUs are commonplace and developers are obliged to implement systems utilizing concurrency in order to obtain optimal performance. Furthermore, we have also recently seen GPUs take center stage for powering general-purpose parallel computing, developers have yet another tool at their disposal for solving computational problems.\n\nIn this session, a high-level overview of Concurnas, focusing on concurrency and GPU programming will first be provided.

As HobbyFarm extensively utilizes controllers, CRDs for data storage, and runs virtual machines within pods, it serves to be a great example of the potential of Kubernetes and demonstrates the flexibility of use for the Kubernetes project.\n\nLearning cloud native technologies typically requires the installation and configuration of tools on a user's workstation or cloud provider. The steps to create an environment with which to learn a new technology can often bog the learner down in unnecessary complications. Barrier to entry for learning cloud native technologies should be as low as possible. HobbyFarm seeks to address some of these issues by providing a browser-based learning tool that places no special requirements on the user outside of an HTML5-compatible browser.\n\nThis talk will provide a concrete example of a tool built on/for/around Kubernetes, and help to illustrate the flexibility of Kubernetes and the various ecosystem projects that are utilized to make the project operate. A vast majority of CRD based controllers and projects are designed to enhance the Kubernetes cluster that they are run in -- HobbyFarm utilizes CRD’s in a non-conventional manner, providing end users the ability to perform cloud-native learning in an environment without necessarily being aware that they are indirectly interacting with a Kubernetes cluster.",

Somebody read a book, and somebody read an article or watched a video.\r\nThere is also enough talk on YouTube. For example, Jason Taylor says the same things at every conference. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that all talks are ideological, like what you should do and you will be fine. At the same time, the authors usually have no practical experience in creating large projects using this architecture (and even launching in production). All examples are too simple and there are still many questions. \r\nThe book describes only general principles and when you start to apply this in practice a lot of questions appear. For example how to create modules, what to put in each module, and how to set up connections between modules.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago Pravo Tech started 2 projects, which applied the principles described in the book.

We'll look at its design and understand in which cases it's a good solution and when it's better to avoid using it (and what to choose instead). We'll also pay special attention to deployment in containers.\n\nThe talk is aimed to practicing engineers delivering Spring Boot applications to production.",

After all, companies have spent a considerable amount of time and money on developing those applications, and despite the lack of perfection, these applications nonetheless keep their companies in operation. So does it make sense for an entire legacy application to be re-written? Keep in mind that the implementation of certain business functionality can be a daunting task for the busy developers. How about if we re-design the system, and identify pieces of the complex business functionality in the legacy system that can potentially be «recycled», and retrofit them into the new system that leverages on the power of the reactive data flow pipeline?\n\nThis presentation will be a lively discussion with hands-on coding to illustrate how to construct a reactive, event-driven data flow pipeline, which are composed of different library implementations of the Reactive Streams specification, such as Akka Streams, Eclipse Vert.x and RxJava. The sample use case will mimic a real-life example of data being collected from multiple distributed sources, which will then be fed to a legacy processor as «wrapped» by a reactive microservice for transformation, after which the resulting data will flow to a «sink» to be prepared for further processing.

However, in an application that is highly collaborative, where users can interact with each other, the request-response paradigm hits its limits. Users expect to see each other’s actions reflected as soon as possible and have become accustomed to real time collaborative experiences.\n\nIn the request-response world, requests for data will typically be initiated from the client, however, in the real time world, it is useful to facilitate the ability for backends to push data to the clients before it’s requested. Building such a system is difficult when the number of clients is large, because every client must maintain a connection to the backend service. The scaling and reliability considerations are significantly more complex than a request-response based system. At Canva, we enabled our users to collaborate with each other by introducing services that support bidirectional streaming with RSocket. This talk discusses the challenges that we faced building these services, and the solutions we used to ensure our reliability requirements were met.",

This talk will be useful both for the audience, which is just starting to automate the testing process and for quite experienced specialists, as well as those who are experimenting with new approaches.\r\n\r\nTesting a very large project is never easy. Several factors contribute to this:\r\n- Specificity: tests in a digital bank are complex. People are working with complex and often long business cases, for example, filling out a payment order;\r\n- Scope: there are many tests, there are also many changes on which you need to run tests;\r\n- Analysis: the great number of reports and test results makes it difficult to analyze problematic tests;\r\n- Structure: there are also many teams writing tests and they are scattered across different divisions of the bank.\r\n\r\nThis caused a great number of problems:\r\n- long and unstable work of tests;\r\n- late detection of defects (after they have entered the release branch code);\r\n- repairing some tests broke others, running all tests on pull request checks was impossible.\r\n\r\nSolving these problems took several years and led to the creation and implementation of several tools and technologies. For example, a testing framework appeared in Sber with its mechanism for finding elements and executing the logic of checks on the browser side. There is also a portal with detailed statistics on test results, a harvester — a tool for analyzing the impact of changes in the code on tests, etc.\r\nThese tools helped significantly, but revealed some organizational and quality problems (speed and stability).

Web forms don't have a decent reputation, and rightfully so. Very often they are inaccessible and difficult to use, with awkward live validation and notorious error messages; not to mention painful dropdowns like a country selector, a birthday date-picker starting from 2020, a tiny newsletter checkbox, a disabled copy-paste for email verification, disabled \"submit\" buttons and horrendously evil CAPTCHAs in the disguise of street signs and crosswalks.\r\n \r\nWhenever a customer will interact with the interface, it will happen via some sort of web form.

This cross-platform SDK allows you to improve development by writing common code once and then reusing it across platforms. The level of code generalization depends only on the developer's desire: from general data models to full-fledged general business logic and even architecture, leaving the only UI on the side of native projects.\r\n\r\nTo organize a truly effective common code base, it is necessary to solve some seemingly trivial tasks, having their specifics and implementation features in a multiplatform application.\r\nOne of these tasks is organizing and configuring connections between application components via DI while maintaining operability and correctness not only on Android but also on iOS.
